This GitHub organization hosts resources for the POLARIS project: Polarization in Online Landscapes and Radical Influence Studies. We're conducting a multimodal investigation of democratic erosion, focusing on how far-right discourse and networks operate on platforms like TikTok, particularly in the UK and Germany. Our interdisciplinary research combines computational and qualitative methods to analyze content, actor networks, and impacts on democratic values. We aim to understand the processes of radicalization, mainstreaming, and polarization, and their effects on the digital public sphere.
