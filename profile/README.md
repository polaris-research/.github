# Welcome to the POLARIS Project GitHub Organization!ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub organization hosts resources for the POLARIS project: Polarization in Online Landscapes and Radical Influence Studies. We're conducting a multimodal investigation of democratic erosion, focusing on how far-right discourse and networks operate on platforms like TikTok, particularly in the UK and Germany. Our interdisciplinary research combines computational and qualitative methods to analyze content, actor networks, and impacts on democratic values. We aim to understand the processes of radicalization, mainstreaming, and polarization, and their effects on the digital public sphere.

- Investigate how radicalization, mainstreaming, and polarization interact within far-right social media networks, especially on TikTok.
- Analyze the multimodal communication strategies employed by far-right actors in the UK and Germany.
- Determine the effectiveness of far-right politicians and influencers in engaging audiences and disseminating their messages.
- Understand the impact of far-right communication on users' views, opinions, and democratic capacities.
- Develop innovative methods for multimodal content analysis.
- Map the transnational far-right network structure on TikTok.
